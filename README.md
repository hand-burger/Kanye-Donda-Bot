# About
 This is a Python web scraper bot to check and notify the release status of Donda by Kanye West using the python requests library which runs in the command line.
 Sadly, it does need to constantly run in order to always be checking, but idk how else to do it ðŸ¤·
 
 
 Once/if the bot ever finds that the album has dropped, it will email you that it has been published
 
 (08/29/21) Now that it has dropped, this is useless, but it works!
 ## Required Python packages
 * Requests
 * Smtplib (if given an error when trying to install it is probably already installed since it comes with Python3 by default)
 * Time
 ## How to run the program
 * First, to run the program download the donda_bot.py file
 * Next, navigate to the location of the file in your file explorer and open a terminal in that directory
 * Now run the program by using the following command `python3 "donda_bot.py"`
